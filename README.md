# Comic Scraper from comicextra.com, but also a reader or something
## APPARENTLY comicextra.com DID SOMETHING AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT'S A WRAPPER FOR readcomicsonline.ru, I DON'T KNOW IF IT WAS LIKE THIS BEFORE BUT AFTER FEW SEARCHES I FOUND OUT THAT THERE ARE A LOT LESS RESULTS, BOOKS ARE MISSING, INCLUDING THE BOOK IN THE TUTORIAL **WHICH I WAS READING!!!** >:(
## i think i'm getting too angry, after all they are "free", yeah i shouldn't complain so much, sorry, i'm very grateful
