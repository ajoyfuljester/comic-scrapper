# Comic Scrap(p)er from azcomix.me (previously comixextra.com), but also a reader or something, idk if it's legal (probably not), but remember to support the creators when you can
## yeah, well, i don't know what to do with this, i think it is pretty good
### if you want something then create an [issue](https://github.com/ajoyfuljester/comic-scrapper/issues) on github or something, i have not used it so i don't know. if it is a bug, i might fix it, if it is a feature, then i will add it if i think it is cool or easy enough

First time using pyside6 and beautiful soup
